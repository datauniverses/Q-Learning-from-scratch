 <h1>Introduction</h1>
I have developed an AI-powered bot that uses the Q-learning algorithm to solve the Taxi Game in Open AI Gym. By leveraging the power of machine learning, the bot can adapt to changing conditions in the game and optimize its performance.




 <h1>System overview</h1>
My bot uses a Q-learning algorithm to learn the optimal strategy for completing the Taxi Game in Open AI Gym. The algorithm learns by trial and error, adjusting the value of each state-action pair based on the rewards it receives during gameplay. The bot can play the game repeatedly and learn from its mistakes, eventually achieving a high level of performance.



 
 <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
 
To use the bot, you will need to have Python and the Open AI Gym library installed on your system, as well as knowledge of basic programming concepts. However, I can provide assistance with the installation process and any technical questions you may have.



 
 # Performance 
The bot has shown impressive results in solving the Taxi Game in Open AI Gym, achieving high scores and completing the game with optimal efficiency. You can see the bot in action and its performance in this YouTube video:        [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR17LTfRjQ4)
